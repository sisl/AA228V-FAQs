# AA228V Programming Project FAQs

_This list continuously grows to reflect common queries made on Ed. You may find your query answered here without even needing to wait on Ed!_

## All Projects

1. **The notebook has errors everywhere!**

    - Wait until the notebook finishes loading, but if the errors still persist then you can update the StanfordAA228V package within the notebook by following the [instructions here](https://github.com/sisl/AA228VProjects/blob/main/media/update-package.gif).

> [!NOTE]
> We integrated last year's FAQs (Winter 2025) into the project notebook files.
> However, we may use this repository to collect new questions from this year's course.
